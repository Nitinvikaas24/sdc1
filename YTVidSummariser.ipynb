African elephants can reach 10 feet tall and weigh 18,000 pounds, with the largest recorded individual being 13 feet tall and weighing 24,000 pounds.  To maintain this size, they consume vast quantities of food and water daily.  Despite their size, they cannot jump due to their slender legs and lack of spring.\n",
            "\n",
            "Elephants exhibit remarkable intelligence, demonstrated by their ability to recognize themselves in mirrors—a capacity shared only by a few other species like great apes, dolphins, and magpies. They also use tools for problem-solving and possess exceptional memories, remembering water sources along migration routes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Their trunks are a unique combination of nose and upper lip, containing thousands of muscle units and capable of both powerful lifting and delicate manipulation.  Elephants use their trunks for various tasks like grasping objects, greeting each other, and showing affection.\n",
            "\n",
            "Elephant tusks, made of strong dentine, are essentially large teeth.  Unfortunately, the demand for ivory from tusks has led to illegal hunting and population decline. While African elephants are listed as vulnerable, Asian elephants are endangered due to habitat loss, fragmentation, poaching, and conflict with humans.  The video emphasizes the importance of conservation efforts to ensure the peaceful coexistence of humans and elephants.\n",
